# How to Use
Currently you can only grab image urls from one website. I'll add more if I feel like I need to, but for now, you can only use https://readcomic.net/  
It will prompt you to choose from a list of websites (currently 1), so pick one.  
Afterwards, it prompts you to enter the full URL for the chapter you want to grab images from.  
It then asks you if you'd like to grab the preceding chapters' images and how many chapters forwards.  
It uses that information to save the image urls to images/Chapter X where X is 1-X.
